### Acceptance Testing with Cucumber

This is the example app for Acceptance Testing with Cucumber tutorial,
presented by Aslak Helles√∏y and David Chelimsky at RailsConf 2010.

Scott Smith has "borrowed" this code to see if it can be used
as a front end to augment some Pivotal Tracker functionality
with swimlanes.

### Recommended environment

* git
* rvm 0.1.40 (if you're on *nix)
* pik (if you're on windows)
* ruby 1.8.7

### Get started

Start off with a clean gemset with rvm or pik:

    rvm gemset create swimlane
    rvm gemset use swimlane

Install a couple of gems you'll need to bootstrap everything else:

    gem install rake bundler

Now do all this:

    git clone git://github.com/dchelimsky/railsconf2010-app.git
    cd railsconf2010-app
    bundle install
    bundle lock
    export RAILS_ENV=development
    rake db:migrate
    rake db:test:prepare
    rake db:seed
    export RAILS_ENV=test
    rake spec
    cucumber

If you run 'cucumber' and 'rake spec' successfully at the end, then all is right with
the world.

To run the server:

    export RAILS_ENV=development
    Rails s

  and open a browser on

    http://localhost:3000/cards
